# Bayesian-TIC-infer

This repo constains the python class that analyzes time-course experimental data of cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells (TICs) using maximum likelihood estimate. As a benchmark, I generate synthetic data with different models and use MLE to infer the true model parameters. More details to come.
